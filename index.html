         He founded what would later become the Tata Group of companies. Jamsetji Tata is regarded as the legendary 
         "Father of Indian Industry".He was so influential in the world of industry that Jawaharlal Nehru referred to Tata 
         as a One-Man Planning Commission.

        "When you have to give the lead in action, in ideas - a lead which does not fit in with the very climate of opinion - that
        is true courage, physical or mental or spiritual, call it what you like, and it is this type of courage and vision that 
        Jamsetji Tata showed. It is right that we should honour his memory and remember him as one of the big founders of modern India.
        " -Jawaharlal Nehru.

        Tata, who in his early life was a merchant, went on to change the business world of India through his many ventures within the
        cotton and pig iron industry, and is known as one of the most important builders of the modern Indian economy. Out of his many
        achievements, Tata is notable for the Tata Iron and Steel Works company in Jamshedpur.In addition to the Tata Iron and Steel 
        Works, he went on to establish businesses in many other areas that stood as a foundation to modern Indian business.
